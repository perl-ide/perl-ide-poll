# The Perl IDE Survey

The [Perl IDE Survey](https://perlide.org) polls people on the text editor that
they use for Perl. This repository holds the code that runs the survey.

The list of editors is in [ides.txt](/ides.txt). There's no particular restriction
about what we allow in that list other than us being aware of it.
